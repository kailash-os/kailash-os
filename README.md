## FAQ

Q. Why the name 'Kailash'?<br>
A. The authors have been long-time users and fans of WHAX/SLAX, BackTrack/Knoppix and Kali Linux. The name "Kailash" is an acknowledgement to credit Kali Linux as the main source of inspiration.
Kailash is also the residence of Lord Shiva in Hindu scriptures.

Q. Why is Kailash based on NixOS and not {Debian|Arch}? <br>
A. The authors have only recently started learning Nix and NixOS and this project provided an opportunity to do a deep-dive.
